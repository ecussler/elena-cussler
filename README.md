# Elena Cussler : React Portfolio [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
  
  ## Description
  This application uses React.js to create a single-page application with several viewports and components. While there is some fine-tuning to be had, this application shows my ability to work with React.js as well as Tailwind/DaisyUI to create a workable user experience and display of my skills. 

  Future development includes: 
  - Streamlining of the Tailwind/DaisyUI styling 
  - Connection to the backend to store Contact Me information 
  - Automatic emails sent upon submission of the Contact Form
  - Further implementation of styles and possibly some animations
